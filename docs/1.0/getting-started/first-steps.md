# First steps

To create your first course, log into your website at `/admin` and go to Tools > Courses.

Click `Add Category` to create your first category for your courses. Enter any name you
wish in the category name prompt.

Once you've created your new category, click on `Add Course` under the category name to
create your first course.

The Add Course form requires a course title and summary, with the other fields being optional.
When the course is created, you will be taken to the page list for the course, where you
can add the first page of contents to your course.

Click `Add Page` and enter a page name when prompted. This will take you to the page editor,
with a list of content objects in the left menu. Click on an object type to add it to the page.
Changes made in the page editor are automatically saved in the background as you work.
